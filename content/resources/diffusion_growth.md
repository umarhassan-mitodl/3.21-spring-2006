description: This Mathematica notebook covers growth of a spherical precipitate from
  supersaturated solution. Calculates rate constant for diffusional growth, interfacial
  velocity, concentration profile in matrix using exact solution. Explores using stationary-field
  approximation to calculate interface velocity and concentration profile. Introduces
  spherical harmonic functions for describing shape perturbations of a sphere.
